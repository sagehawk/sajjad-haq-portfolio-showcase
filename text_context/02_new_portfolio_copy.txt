## SECTION 1: NEW FEATURED CASE STUDY (To be placed ABOVE the existing "Shipped Projects")
---

### Main Header:
Featured Case Study: From Idea to Architecture

### Sub-Header:
This is a deep dive into my process for architecting a user-centric application from the ground up, combining product strategy, UX/UI design, and front-end architecture.

### Project Card: The Social Dojo
---

### Title:
The Social Dojo

### Tagline:
AI-powered conversation trainer for building social confidence.

### Description:
A full-stack "flight simulator" for social skills designed to turn conversational anxiety into a trainable skill. This project showcases my end-to-end product development process, from identifying a user problem to designing a comprehensive UI/UX in Figma and architecting a scalable front-end system.

### Metadata:
- Role: Product Architect, UX/UI Designer, Front-End Developer
- Technologies Planned: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Gemini API, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
- Status: In Development (Design & Architecture Complete)

### Page Title:
Case Study: The Social Dojo

### Part 1: Introduction
- **The Problem:** The "awkward silence" is a universal source of social anxiety. For ambitious professionals, it can be a barrier to building crucial relationships. Our target user, "Alex," feels this pain point regularly, struggling to move beyond simple pleasantries in workplace conversations.
- **The Solution (The Dojo Method):** The Social Dojo tackles this by providing a private gym for social skills. Our 3-step system (The Sparring Room, The Follow-Up Engine, The Instant Replay) empowers users to practice, fail safely, and get actionable feedback, building real conversational muscle memory.

### Part 2: The Strategic Presentation
- **Section Header:** Product Strategy & User Flow
- **Action:** Embed the Figma Presentation Slide Deck here using the link provided.

### Part 3: Technical Architecture
- **Section Header:** From Design to Code: The Technical Blueprint
- **Bullet Points:**
    - **Front-End:** Built with Next.js and TypeScript for a robust, type-safe application. The UI will be constructed using a component library based on Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
    - **State Management:** Global state, such as user authentication and mission progress, will be managed using Zustand (or React Context) for a lightweight and efficient solution. Local component state will handle UI interactions within the chat and mission views.
    - **API Integration:** The core chat functionality will interface with a backend service that calls the Google Gemini API. The front-end is designed to handle real-time message streams and update the UI asynchronously.
    - **Backend & Auth:** User data, authentication, and database management will be handled by Supabase, providing a scalable and secure backend-as-a-service.
