              I'm a developer who thinks like a founder because I've been one.

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              For the last few years, I founded and ran Ceramic Catalysts, a tech agency where I built 
              performance-focused solutions for the automotive detailing industry. This wasn't just about code; 
              it was about driving real business outcomesâ€”like cutting page load times to under 1s to boost 
              ceramic coating leads by 40%, or using AI to slash lead response times and dramatically improve close rates.
            </p>
            
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              After graduating with my CS degree, I've decided to go all-in on my passion for the craft itself. 
              I'm now seeking a full-time role where I can go deep on a single product, contribute to a team of 
              talented engineers, and help build scalable, user-centric applications.
