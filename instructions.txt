For the embed for the presentation slides we need to use this url instead https://www.figma.com/deck/XHF26DUgCc2yPkoEHh72zE/Untitled?node-id=3-29&t=clgsp3ycYSSRMQko-1
becaues the previous one just took us straight to page 10, but we need to start on page 1.
here's the embed link figma creates not sure if you need this:
<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/slides/XHF26DUgCc2yPkoEHh72zE/Untitled?node-id=3-29&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

also at the end where we have that jpg, we're left with nothing at the bottom, I think we should have something there so the user doens't have to scroll all the way back to the top
